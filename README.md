### Hi there 👋
- I'm Dan
- I'm currently working as an Enterprise App Architect for Google Cloud ☁️
- I enjoy finding solutions to problems raised by fellow developers and architects... and making some demos for them... and making them run fast... 🏎
- I’m always learning about something new ... 🌱
- Generative AI in the enterprise opens up endless possibilities 🆒
- Last-drop serverless optimization is so fun...🤔
