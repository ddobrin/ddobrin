### Hi there 👋
- I'm Dan
- I'm currently working as an Enterprise App Modernization Architect in Google Cloud. ☁️
- I enjoy finding solutions for problems raised by fellow developers and architects... and making some demos for them... and make them run fast...
- I’m always learning about something new ... 🌱
